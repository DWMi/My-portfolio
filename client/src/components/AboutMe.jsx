        I'm born and raised in Ã–rebro and I moved to Gothenburg in the beginning of 2019 to work here as a chef/cook and certain things happened and I decided to change my career to be a Web-developer. <br/>Right now I'm almost finished with my studies at Medieinstitutet as a Fullstack developer <em>("17th May is the graduation")</em>.  I'm living right now with my brother and my two cats Nikita and Mini. In my free time I like to go fishing by the lakes, or just being in the nature if the weather is nice, otherwise I'll just be indoors infront of my PC.
